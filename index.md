### ML Model Deployment - Faulty Steel Plates
[Project link](https://github.com/garne041/Faulty-Steel-Plates)

The Semion Research Center of Sciences of Communication released a dataset based on image characteristics of faulty steel plates. Six types of defects (Pastry, Z Scratch, K Scratch, Stains, Dirtiness, and Bumps) plus "Other" were identified. The input feature space was based on 27 indicators supplied by the Centro Sviluppo Materiali.

The major focus of this project is to demonstrate putting models in production. I performed exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and created a working viable model which would be needed to demonstrate productionalization. I've broken model productionalization down into four sections: experiment tracking, establishing context, model registry, and model deployment inside of Azure Databricks using mlflow.

ML Model Production Skills Reviewed:
- Experiment Tracking
- Model Registry
- Model Deployment

### GIS Tableau Visualization
[USFIA Tennessee Forestland Species Distribution](https://github.com/garne041/USFIA-Tennessee-Forestland)
In this project, I prepare the data for visualization with Python and visualize the cleaned geospatial data with Tableau.

I focused on highlighting wood species distribution surrounding the 5 largest cities in Tennessee: Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville, Clarkesville, and Chattanooga. I've included the Python script and a link to the finished [Tableau visualization](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/joy.garnett/viz/TennesseeSpeciesDistribution/TNForestryDashboard).

### Python Package Development: Feature Generation
[Chem_calc](https://github.com/garne041/chem_calc)

[https://pypi.org/project/chem-calc/](https://pypi.org/project/chem-calc/)

The module chem_calc calculates chemical and physical properties based on the stoichometry of a chemical compound.

The 20+ available properties (or features) used in this package are elemental properties from the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics as well as the NIST X-ray Mass Attenuation Coefficients Database.
